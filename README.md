# Chess-Dungeon

## Welcome to Chess Dungeon
In this game, every turn you will change pieces. Defeat enemies to add them to your queue of avaliable pieces. Reach the flag at the end of the dungeon to win.

# How to play
You start out as 3 kings. As a king, you can only move 1 square at a time. You goal is to reach the flag somewhere near the end of the dungeon. Enemy pieces will come and harass you as you progress. If you move into their line of sight, you'll die and lose the game. If you beat them, you add them to your queue and you can change into those pieces.

## Potential Questions
How big is the Dungeon?
The dungeon itself is only 5x5, not including the starting area and the area where you earn a freebie piece. Procedural generation was planned but there wasn't enough time to work it out.

Is there only 1 javascript file?
Yes, the design is less than stellar. If I was to continue on this, I would definitely start with refactoring the existing code.

Any future plans for the game?
Originally it was suppose to be procedurally generated, but time constraints prevented me from finishing that. Also, another idea was to do some kind of deck building so you get to pick your pieces before the game started. If I had more time, I would also make more custom pieces that have unique move patterns, along with an endless mode. Also sound and nicer animations would be nice.

Why did you pick this?
This was the easiest idea with minimal assets. Basically I didn't have time to create anything, nor did I have time to search for assets, so the idea of using chess pieces for a dungeon crawler seemed brilliant at the time. The only thing I did make was the flag.
